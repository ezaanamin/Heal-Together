I've been living with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia. My journey with mental health began at a young age when I started experiencing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. As I got older, the symptoms of schizophrenia became more pronounced, leading to periods of paranoia and delusions.I'm a strong advocate for mental health awareness and actively participate in support groups and therapy sessions. Despite the challenges I face, I remain resilient and strive for a better understanding of my conditions. My primary motivation in joining the mental health community is to seek understanding and support from others who may be going through similar experiences. I believe in the power of sharing personal stories and reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, and I'm open to connecting with others to build a supportive network. My journey is a testament to my courage in confronting mental health issues head-on and my determination to live a fulfilling life."",""user_cover_pic"":""cover_photo.jpg""}","{""depression"":false,""anxiety"":false,""bipolar"":false,""ptsd"":false,""ocd"":true,""schizophrenia"":true,""eatingDisorders"":false,""other"":false}","{""copingTechniques"":false,""personalStories"":true,""medication"":true,""reducingStigma"":true,""healthyLifestyle"":false,""spirituality"":true,""otherInterests"":false}","{""meditation"":true,""creativeActivities"":true,""talking_to_friends_family"":false,""exercising"":true,""professional_help"":false,""copingother"":false}",[]
